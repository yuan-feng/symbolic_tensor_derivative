### Tensor Derivative for Continuum Mechanics.

This is a Symbolic Programming kit in Mathematica. 
The purpose of the development is to obtain the analytical
derivatives of complicated formulations in the elastoplasticity.

The Vector and Tensor Systems are defined.
The derivative operators are defined. 

The example is the tensor derivatives for a modified Hyperblic 
Drucker-Prager yield surface.
